			<h3>Quickstart - Market Mayhem</h3>
			</p>

			<p>
			Quickstart rules teach the basic Market Place and Global Event mechanics in a game that works in an on itself. Basically, it's the Full Game without Character and Emblem card classes, Dragon's Nest and Dragon's Hoard Game Zones and Black Markets. It's a perfect solution to teach the game in bite-size chunks. When the Players are done learning the core mechanics, it's time to unleash the dragons and the characters.
			</p>
			<p>
			Learning Dragon's Money Laundering on one sitting can be a daunting undertaking. That's why the core rules have been split to two tiers of rule sets to enable learning the game mechanics as efficiently as possible, and adding more complex functionality as players progress.
			</p>
			<p>
			This will step you through the required knowledge to play a very simplified version of Dragon's Money Laundering, known as Market Mayhem. Keep in mind this section is only a selection of the normal rules, and should not be refered to unless playing only Market Mayhem.

						<div class="hidden_div">

							<p>
							Dice rolling is used in three distinct sequences to settle the conditional nature of the outcome of specific actions. The first time is during the Setup Stage when deciding the starting controller of the Initiative Badge and it only happens once a game. Every other roll during the game is either to determine whether an Acquisition Attempt is successful or not, or whether the Thief is put to Exile or back to the Global Event Deck.
							</p>

							<p>
							Dragon's Money Laundering rewards Players for rolling doubles, save rolling double ones. There are three categories of doubles and they all have different effects that trigger if they're rolled. The categories are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<h4><li>Dabo!</h4>
									<p>
									
									Dabo! is triggered when a Player rolls double twos, threes, fours or fives. The triggering Player may immediately re-roll the dice in hope of a higher score. The Player may re-roll even if the initial roll would have failed or for that matter succeeded.
									</p>

									<p>
									Dabo! can trigger during Initiative Badge Roll-Off or during the actual game during Acquisition Attempts. It may be used to achieve higher results on Initiative Badge Roll-Off, if the Player is not happy with the triggering roll. However, the Player has to keep the following non-Dabo! result even, if it's lower than the former roll. All subsequent Dabo! results naturally yield a new optional re-roll.
									</p>

									<p>
									Dabo! can be used in many ways. Re-rolling successful Acquisition Attempts can be used to try force the probabilities on Wyvern Eyes or Woot! Woot! results.
									</p>

									<p>
									It is customary to shout 'Dabo!' out loud, when Dabo! is triggered.
									</p>
									
								<h4><li>Woot! Woot!</h4>
									<p>
									
									Woot! Woot! is triggered when a Player rolls double sixes. Despite being a double, Woot! Woot! can't be re-rolled.
									</p>

									<p>Woot! Woot! is an automatic success regardless of the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt. Additionally, any Woot! Woot! result will immediately trigger Foreign Merchant Sequence after the triggering action.
									</p>

									<p>
									During the Initiative Badge Roll-Off any Player rolling Woot! Woot! will immediately be awarded the Initiative Badge and the remaining Players are denied the chance to roll for the Initiative Badge anymore.
									</p>

									<p>
									It is customary to shout 'Woot! Woot!' and wave your hands above your head when Woot! Woot! is triggered.
									</p>
								<h4><li>Wyvern Eyes</h4>
									<p>
									Wyvern Eyes is triggered when a Player rolls double ones. Despite being a double, Wyvern Eyes can't be re-rolled.
									</p>

									<p>
									Wyvern Eyes is an automatic failure regardless of the Target Value of the Acquisition Attempt. Additionally, any Wyvern Eyes result will immediately trigger the Dragon Siege Sequence.
									</p>

									<p>
									During the Initiative Badge Roll-Off, if each Player rolls Wyvern Eyes, they are thereby denied all access to this game until they learn how to roll dice properly.
									</p>

									<p>
									Depending on the Player's situation, it is customary to groan in pain or snigger gleefully when Wyvern Eyes is triggered.
									</p>
							</ul>
							<p>
							Acquisition Attempt and Thief rolls can initiate game sequences that start immediately after resolving the triggering action.
							</p>

							<p>
							Rolls during the Setup Stage of the game only grant re-rolls and instant successess.

							<p>
							Global Event cards model the shifting and unpredictable economical and sociopolitical climate in Four Corners. Global Event cards modify game Rounds in unpredictable ways and give advantage to different Players. Taking the risks at the right time, when others can't react to them is a key ability of any Player.
							</p>	

							<p>
							Each Global Event Type has two distinct effect attributes: a Player Effect and a Market Effect. Player Effects favor Player's with less cards in their Treasury and gives them better chance at getting back in to the game, whereas Market Effects can manipulate Face Values of individual cards or make Acquisition Attempts safer or more difficult to execute.
							</p>
							<p>
							Player Effects are structured as follows:
							</p>
							<p>
							The Global Event card states what effect applies on each Player.
							Any Player that has less cards than the current Global Event Face Value ignores the Player Effect
							</p>
							<p>
							Market Effects are structured as follows:
							</p>
							<p>
							The Global Event card states what effect is applied on the Resource cards in play.
							Each Global Event Type has a unique effect, but the range is always inclusive to the Global Event Face Value. The Global Event affects Resource cards with Face Value less or more than -- depending on the Global Event Type --, or equal to the Global Event Face Value.
							Player Effect resolves selectively, Market Effect is unconditional to all Players.
							</p>
							<p>
							Player Effects resolve at the start of the Round and their effects last until the end of the Round, regardless if Players' Treasury sizes change.
							</p>
							<p>
							Attributes: <br>
							Global Event Type
							</p>
							<p>
							There are four basic Global Event Types and a one catch-all special Global Event Type; there is one for each suites number cards from 2 to 9 and a one separate for tens, picture cards and jokers. The Global Event Type is indicated by the printed suite of the Global Event card. The different basic Global Event Types are:
							</p>
							<p>
							
							<ul>
								<li><b>Decadence</b>
									<p>
									Player Effect: Players can't play Character Ultimate Powers.<br>
									Market Effect: Players can only bid Primary or Secondary Buying Resources that have Face Values of more than or equal to the Global Event Face Value in Acquisition and Seize Attempts.
									</p>
							
								<li><b>Tax Relief</b>
									<p>
									Player Effect: Players don't have a Black Market Phase during this round. However, a Market Phase can always be substituted for one.<br>
									Market Effect: All Resources in the Market Place with Face Values of more than or equal to the Active Global Event Global Event Face Value receive a -2 modifier to their Face Value until the end of Round.
									</p>
									
								<li><b>Contraband Crackdown</b>
									<p>
									Player Effect: Players can't make any Seize Attempts.<br>
									Market Effect: Players can only bid Primary or Secondary Buying Resources that have Face Values less than or equal to the Global Event Face Value in Acquisition and Seize Attempts.
									</p>
								
								<li><b>Marauders</b>
									<p>
									Player Effect: Each Player discards a card at random and puts it in to the Dragon's Hoard. <br>
									Market Effect: All Resources in the Market Place with Face Values of more than or equal to the Active Global Event card Global Event Face Value receive a +2 modifier to their Face Value until end of Round.
									</p>

								<li><b>Carnival of Coin - Special Global Event Type</b>
									<p>
									Player Effect: Each Player has an extra Market Action at the start of their Market Phase.<br>
									Market Effect: The respective Global Event Types of different Global Event cards are listed in the Card Index. Resolving Global Event cards is explained in the Gameplay section.
									</p>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
							Global Event Face Value: Global Event cards with a basic Global Event Type have an inherent Face Value that is the printed value on the card. This value indicates how powerful the Global Event is and who and what Resource cards the Global Effect card affects.

							<p>
							There are many ways to win a game of Dragon's Money Laundering. The game has been designed so that at no point can one be absolutely certain about one's victory. Even the Players that have lost everything at some point of the game have a slight chance at a comeback. Sometimes ruining someone else's game is as good a tactic as the other. Victory can and must be taken by any means necessary. There are no second places.
							</p>
							<p>
							<ul>
								
								<h4><li>Monopoly</h4>
								<p>
								If at any point in the game a Player's Treasury has all the Resource cards from 2 to 9 of the same Resource Type, that Player can immediately declare a Monopoly. The Resource Type can be any of the four basic Resource Types. When a Monopoly is declared the game ends immediately regardless of the game state. For example, the Player can't lose those cards, because of a Character Ultimate Power waiting to resolve. Victory Points are not counted and the Player who achieved Monopoly will be declared winner. <BR>
								N.B. A Monopoly doesn't require a Guild House; tens are excluded.
								</p>
								
								
								<h4><li>Ultimate Victory</h4>
								<p>
								If at any point in the game a Player's Treasury has all four Dragon Egg cards in it, that Player can immediately declare an Ultimate Victory. When an Ultimate Victory is declared the game ends immediately regardless of the game state. For example, the Player can't lose those cards, because of a Character Ultimate Power waiting to resolve. Victory Points are not counted and the Player who achieved the Ultimate Victory will be declared winner.
								</p>
								
								
								<p>
								<h4><li>Victory Point</h4>
								When the Global Event Deck is completely depleted and the Dealer must draw a new Active Global Event but is unable, the game ends.
								</p>

								<p>At this point the Players reveal their Merchant King cards and thus their Secret Desired Resource.
								</p>

								<p>
								Players remove all non-Resource and non-Dragon Egg cards from their Treasuries and Emblem Zones. They don't yield any Victory Points.
								</p>

								<p>
								Players tally their Victory Points from Resource and Dragon Egg cards in their Treasury and Emblem Zones, apply their Merchant King's Secret Desired Resource modifiers and Guild House Resource Bonus Victory Points.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								The Player with the highest score will be declared winner.
								</p>

								<p>
								Victory Point Counting System <br>
								Counting Victory Points incorrectly is time consuming and cumbersome to each Player involved. A systematical approach is recommended. The following sequence is just an example, but the bottom line is that modifiers and bonuses should be applied on totals not individual cards.
								</p>
								<p>

								<ol>
									<li>Separate all different Resource Types in their own stacks.
									<li>Add up each stack's total Face Values individually. <br>
										If the Resource Type matches the Secret Desired Resource, double the stack total at this point.
									<li>Apply Resource Bonus on each applicable stack.
									<li>Sum up each stack's total.
								</ol>
								</p>
							</ul>
