			<h3>The Rules - Gameplay</h3>

			<p>
			A game of Dragon's Money Laundering flows through series of sequences and subsequences much like a computer program with nested subroutine calls. Some of them are repeated for each Player, and some might trigger unexpectedly due to dice rolling or drawing a specific card from the Event Deck. Every step during these sequences happens in series, so there is no ambiguity on what resolves and when. Any unexpected subsequences will return to their spawn-point and the game will continue from the next step of the spawning parent sequence.</p>

			<p>
			The game table is divided into Zones that different game rules, events and actions interact with. Zones provide a clean uncluttered gaming area and meaning to regular playing cards that reside within them.
			</p>

			<p>
			The cards of a regular playing card deck circulate the game Zones throughout the game sequences. The sequence rules provide unambiguous instructions on how to move the playing cards around legally during the game. Players try to collect specific cards or amass as many cards as possible before the end of the game.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
			
			<p>
			Learning about Dragon's Money Laundering gameplay happens by first understanding the basic concepts introduced in the Game Component Reference section. Players need to know all legal Zones where cards can be located during the game, and they need to know the special rules concerning Dice Rolling and the more unconventional Victory Conditions.
			</p>

			<p>
			When a Player knows how to find the aforementioned information quickly, the Player can follow the game sequences to the letter and be able to play the game in full.
			</p>

			<p>
			N.B. <br>
			Game sequence printout sheet will show exactly the steps to take and the condition checks that alter that flow. By following those steps exactly the game will proceed without offending the rules.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Initiative Badge</h3>
			
			<p>
			DML encourages each Player to learn the game mechanics as early as possible and enables a simple, yet effective, learning aid from the very beginning. The Player with the Initiative Badge works as the dealer through the Setup Stage. Similarly, during the Game Stage the dealer changes as the Rounds change.
			</p>

			<p>
			The dealer's responsibility is to follow the gameplay sequences, draw cards, create Black Markets, place cards to Dragon's Hoard, Dragon's Nest and Exile. The dealer will also prompt Character Powers between Turns and has the first chance to use a Character Power action.
			</p>

			<p>
			When all Players are proficient with the game rules, the dealer may start delegating Setup Stage work to make things more fluid.
			</p>

			<p>
			<h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
			</p>

			<p>
			The game ends when a trigger shifts the game state to End Stage. The game comes to a natural end when the Event Deck is depleted at the start of a new Round, but winning can happen in multiple ways.
			</p>

			<p>
			<h3>Gameplay Jargon</h3>
			</p>

			<p>
			Sequence
			</p>

			<p>
			A sequence is a list of instructions that tell the Players what to do at which point of the game. In turn, the instructions that make up a sequence can be classified as steps, actions or phases.
			</p>

			<p>
			When a sequence runs out of items to perform, it will return to its parent sequence and continue executing that from the next step from where it left off. By following the sequences in a serial fashion the game will lead the Players through itself in an unambiguous manner.
			</p>

			<p>
			Stage
			</p>

			<p>
			A stage is a greater whole that needs to be completed before moving to the next stage. It is a logical construct that helps to decouple unrelated game mechanics and makes learning the game in steps easier.
			</p>

			<p>
			Dragon's Money Laundering is divided into three main game stages:
			</p>

			<p>
			Setup
			Game
			End
			</p>

			<p>
			Each one of these stages has a base sequence that consists of subsequences that themselves might consist of other subsequences. When the base sequence runs to completion or is interrupted by an appropriate trigger the game moves on to a new Stage.
			</p>

			<p>
			Phase
			</p>

			<p>
			A phase is an entity that always involves a subsequence. A phase can consist of sub-phases, steps and actions.
			</p>

			<p>
			Step
			</p>

			<p>
			A step is an atomic and self-sufficient part of a sequence. It's a single instruction.
			</p>

			<p>
			Action
			</p>

			<p>
			An action is similar to a step, but always requires input from a Player.
			</p>
