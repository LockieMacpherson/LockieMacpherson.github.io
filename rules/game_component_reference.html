			<h3>The Rules - Game Component Reference</h3>
			<p>
			Dragon's Money Laundering is designed to work on minimal resources. Dice rolls, cards and sections of the playing table, called Zones, all convey multiple meanings that interact with the rules sequences and each other. On the first read-through, players are encouraged to learn about these Game Components in the given order: Zones, Cards and Dice Rolls.
			</p>

			<p>
			Zones indicate the parts of the gaming area that different rules apply to. They provide a well-defined sandbox to various player actions.
			</p>

			<p>
			To squeeze out enough complexity out of limited amount of cards DML utilizes polymorphism. Basically this means that cards can mean different things in different Zones. Card Reference explains how DML encodes information to regular cards and how they interface with the game rules.
			</p>

			<p>
			Rolling the dice is a core feature of the game and it is used to settle all in-game transactions of goods. However, specific dice roll results can initiate special game sequences that are explained in the Dice Rolls section.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Zones</h3>
			<p>
			The gaming table and the players' hands form the playing area of Dragon's Money Laundering. In order to give meaning to regular playing cards and confirm player actions' legality, the players need to establish the Zones in which the cards reside.
			</p>

			<p>
			Refer to the Quick Reference printout sheet for the correct positions of the Zones.
			</p>

			<p>
			The playing area in Dragon's Money Laundering is divided into 10 Zones:

			Active Global Event
			Character Ultimate Power Stack
			Dragon's Hoard
			Dragon's Nest
			Emblem
			Exile
			Global Event Deck
			Marketplace
			Merchant King
			Treasury
			All interactions with the listed Zones are explained in Gameplay section.
			</p>

			<h3>Card Reference</h3>
			<p>
			This rules section explains all the different Card Classes and their possible subclasses. Additionally, there is a Card Index that takes these Card Classes and assigns them to each respective cards of the deck. Card Index also lists all the values of card specific attributes and as such is the primary source of reference after a Player has firmly grasped the concept and content of Card Classes.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Dice Roll</h3>
			
			<p>
			Dice rolling is used in three distinct sequences to settle the conditional nature of the outcome of specific actions. The first time is during the Setup Stage when deciding the starting controller of the Initiative Badge and it only happens once a game. Every other roll during the game is either to determine whether an Acquisition Attempt is successful or not, or whether the Thief is put to Exile or back to the Global Event Deck.
			</p>

			<p>
			Dragon's Money Laundering rewards Players for rolling doubles, save rolling double ones. There are three categories of doubles and they all have different effects that trigger if they're rolled. The categories are:

			Dabo!
			Woot! Woot!
			Wyvern Eyes
			Acquisition Attempt and Thief rolls can initiate game sequences that start immediately after resolving the triggering action.
			</p>

			<p>
			Rolls during the Setup Stage of the game only grant re-rolls and instant successess.
			</p>
